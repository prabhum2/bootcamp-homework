## PlotBot5.py

The below code is for a Python based Twitter Bot.
The bot receives tweets via mentions and in turn performs sentiment analysis
on the most recent twitter account specified in the mention (i.e. A user
tweets: "@PlotBot Analyze: @CNN" and in turn the code will trigger sentiment
analysis on the CNN twitter feed). A plot from the sentiment analysis is
then tweeted to the PlotBot5 twitter feed. Notable libraries used to
complete this application include: Matplotlib, Pandas, Tweepy,
TextBlob, and Seaborn.
